# dro_editor
A Danganronpa Online data editor with a lot of (possible) features

## How to build it ?
- Install Rust programming language tool called [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `cargo build` to get a build (is in `target` folder) or `cargo run` to build and run. `--release` to get optimized version. 
- And it's (possibily) done !!
